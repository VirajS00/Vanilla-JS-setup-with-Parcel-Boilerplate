# Vanilla JS setup with Parcel Boilerplate

Inspiration taken from this [repository](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanilla-parcel-boilerplate).

## How to use

Install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

For development

```
npm run dev
```

For the build (on port 3000)

```
npm run build
```

After running the dev comand, you can edit the files inside the **app folder**. It contains `SCSS` files as well as `JS` files with a **components folder** for each of them.
